# General Tips

- **Incompatible Engine**  
  If an engine is incompatible with a module:  
  `yarn global add <your-app> --ignore-engines`

- **Yarn to NPM**  
  Even if a package specifies Yarn, try using NPM with the same command format (`npm install` instead of `yarn add`).

- **Install Multiple Packages**  
  Install multiple packages at once, e.g.:  
  `npm install react-leaflet @mui/material`
