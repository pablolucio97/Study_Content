- Implement user preferences and settings storage using LocalStorage or IndexedDB.
- Use advanced browser APIs (e.g., Geolocation, WebRTC, Clipboard API).


## NodeJS back-end developer skills

- Know which architectures, strategies and technologies to use in a project and why (if the project will be monolith, serverless, or microservices, what kind of database using and so on).
- Architecture and develop services respecting SOLID principles.
- Handle CRUD operations with Node.js and frameworks like NestJS or Express.
- Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth, Google/Facebook logins).

- Use TypeScript for type safety in backend development.
- Build RESTful APIs with proper error handling and validation using Zod or Joi.
- Manage background tasks using queues (Bull.js or RabbitMQ).
- Handle file uploads (e.g., Multer for Express, S3 bucket integrations).
- Implement middleware for logging and request validation.
- Write integration and unit tests using Jest or Mocha.
- Monitor and debug using tools like Sentry or CloudWatch.
- Use Docker for containerizing applications.
- Apply CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
- Set up GraphQL subscriptions for real-time data.
- Handle API rate limiting and security with tools like Helmet.js and rate-limiter-flexible.
- Work with WebSocket protocols for real-time communication.
- Use message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ for distributed systems.
- Use third services APIs like Stripe, PandaVideo and so on.
- Implement a service to send emails.
- Create, publish and use Docker's  images from Docker Hub.
- Standardize responses according the processed error nature.
- Implement end-points to communicate with OpenAI and similar AI services.
  
## React Native mobile developer skills

- Build React Native apps with Expo for development.
- Implement navigation with React Navigation and Expo Router.
- Manage app state using Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
- Perform API integrations and caching with React Query or Axios.
- Handle animations using libraries like Reanimated or React Native Animatable.
- Implement push notifications with Firebase or OneSignal.
- Work with native modules for advanced features (e.g., Camera, Bluetooth).
- Optimize app performance by reducing re-renders and unnecessary memory usage.
- Debug React Native apps with Flipper or React Native Debugger.
- Set up deep linking for app routing.
- Use testing frameworks like Detox or Jest for mobile apps.
- Configure release builds for iOS and Android with Expo EAS.
- Implement secure storage for sensitive data (e.g., AsyncStorage, SecureStore).
- Handle platform-specific styles and functionalities with React Native Platform API.
- Work with device sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope.
- Handle device permissions and edge cases (e.g., camera, location).
- Optimize app size by analyzing and reducing bundle size.
- Implement crash reporting and performance monitoring with tools like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics.
- Manage app lifecycle events (foreground, background) effectively.
