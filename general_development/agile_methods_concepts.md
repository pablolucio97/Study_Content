# AGILE METHODS

## CONCEPTS

### SPRINT
A cycle of task execution by the development team.

### 3V's CONCEPT
Vision, Value, Validation. These concepts are used to solve problems by viewing, generating value through an action, and confirming validation.

### LEAN
Focus on avoiding waste.

### AGILE
Being rapidly responsive to changes.

### PRODUCT MANAGER
Responsible for overseeing the development and lifecycle of a product.

### PRODUCT BACKLOG
A list of demands or features for the software being developed.

### PROJECT MANAGER
Responsible for the specifications of how the product delivery process will be conducted.

### IKIWISHI
"I'll Know It When I See It" - a term used to express that a client only knows what they want after seeing it.

### PRODUCT GOAL
Development steps of an application aimed at achieving the product vision through a roadmap. Each step should be measured as a goal.

### SPRINT PLANNING
The process of defining which functionalities will be included in the next sprint goal.

### B2B
Business-to-Business.

### P2P
Peer-to-Peer.

## SCRUM

### Roles
- **Product Owner:** Supports and manages tasks for the development team.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates communication between development teams, marketing, other professionals, clients, and managers. Responsible for helping solve organizational problems.
- **Development Team:** Developers who work on the product, ideally including a mix of specialists like testers, front-end, back-end developers, etc.

### Process
- Functional requirements (product backlog) are defined by the product owner and passed to the development team in a meeting to decide which functionalities will be included in the current sprint.
- Each developer works on the assigned backlogs.
- At the end of the sprint, two meetings are held: a review meeting and a retrospective meeting.

## KANO MODEL

A model created to define the value of each functionality for customers. After estimating the story points, assess the impact of each function's existence or absence. Classify each function as obligatory, linear, or exciting.

## DEFINITION OF DONE

A set of criteria that an application should meet before going to the production environment:
- Build passing locally and on the server.
- All unit tests OK.
- All functionality tests OK.
- Acceptance criteria met (defined in Kano).
- Release notes created (if it's a new feature).

## XP MODEL

Practices include TDD, Continuous Integration, and Code Patterns.
- **Code Patterns:** Conventions for variable declaration, code structure, error handling, and comments.
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development):** Testing the software before development.
- **Continuous Integration:** Updating projects stored on servers like GitHub whenever changes are made.

## GENERAL TIPS

- Focus on understanding the mindset of agile methods.
- Be responsive to changes.
- Complete sprints with solutions that resolve customer issues.
- Deliver good value in your software.
- Implement functions according to demand and strive for technical excellence.
- "T-Shaped" professionals are desirable: broad knowledge in many areas with deep expertise in one.
- Have a PRODUCT VISION BOARD before starting projects.
- Estimate development time using story points, not hours.
- Define application criteria before starting a sprint.
