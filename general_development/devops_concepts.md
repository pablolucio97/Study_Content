# DEVOPS

DevOps is a culture of development that integrates the development team with the operations team, encompassing the processes of Code, Build, Integration, Tests, Releases, Deploy, and Operation to achieve continuous delivery for clients. DevOps does not replace Agile Methods and should be used in conjunction with them.

People in an enterprise with a DevOps culture should be open to learning skills constantly. The projects and processes should be comprehensible to both developers and infrastructure teams. Everyone should be aware of what is happening in the organization.

## CI/CD

CI: Continuous Integration.
CD: Continuous Delivery.

The Development Cycle in DevOps is split into five stages: Development, Tests, Integration, Deploy, and Monitoring.

### Continuous Development
This stage involves control of the application versioning.

### Continuous Test
This stage involves testing new functionalities to verify if the system runs perfectly after new functionality implementation.

### Continuous Integration
This is the stage of automation of builds and tests. Tools like Jenkins are useful for checking git changes and deploying automatically.

### Continuous Deploy
In this stage, the application is passed to the production environment and is operational for the end-user. The difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deploy is that deploy is done automatically, whereas delivery is done manually.

### Continuous Monitoring
In this stage, the application is under monitoring, and testing should continue.
