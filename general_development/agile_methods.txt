========================AGILE METHODS============================

--------------------------CONCEPTS-------------------------------

SPRINT: Cycle of execution of task by developer team.

3V's CONCEPT: Vision, Value, Validation. Theses concetps are used 
to solve your problems. You view, generate a value with an action
and confirm a validation.

LEAN: Avoid wasting.

AGILE: Be fastly responsive to changes.

PRODUCT MANAGER:  

PRODUCT BACKLOG: Is a demand of the software that your are deve-
loping, a functionalitie, a resource.

PROJECT MANAGER: Are the spacifications of how the process to de-
livery your product will be done.

IKIWISHI: Is an Englihs term used to say that the client only
know something when this can be see it.

PRODUCT GOAL: Are steps of development of your application vi-
ewing to reach to attend the product vision trought the road-
map. Each step should be measured as a goal.

SPRINT PLANING: Is the action of defines wich functionalities
will enter in the next sprint goal.

----------------------------SCRUM--------------------------------

Papers:

Product Owner: Is responsable to support manager tasks for the 
dev team and support with your doubts.

Scrum Master: Is the responsable communicate between with the
dev teams, teams of marketing, another professional envolded
in the process, clients, managers and etc. Is responsable for
help to solve all problems in the organization.

Dev team: Are the developers that develop the product. The ideal
is have most type of developers in the team; tester, front-end,
back-end, and others.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCRUM process works this way:

The functional requirements (produck backlog) are defined by the
product owner and passed to dev team in a first meetup where will 
be defined which functionlities will be enter in the current 
sprint.

Each dev of the team develop the backlogs that are commited to he.

At finishing the sprint are two meet ups: review meet up and re-
tropsective meet up.

--------------------------KANO MODEL-------------------------------

The Kano Model was created for define the value of each functiona-
lities for your clientes. After estimate the story point of each 
functionality of your application you should stimate the value 
for your customer.

The value of each functionality of you app can be measured questio-
ning the impact of each existence and the not existence of each 
function in your app. Each function should be classfied as obliga-
toly, linear or exciting.

-----------------------DEFINITION OF DONE---------------------------

Definition of done is a set of criterics that you app should be at-
tend before to go for production environment. These cricterics are:

- Build passsing localy and in the server.
- All unity tests OK.
- All functionalities tests OK.
- Critercs of aception OK (defined in Kano).
- Releases notes createds (if is a new feature).


--------------------------XP MODEL---------------------------------

The practices of the XP Model are TDD, Continuos Integration and 
Code Patterns.

Code Patterns: Are the conventions of the var delcaration, code 
structure, errro threating and comments.

TDD: Is the thecninc of frist test the software before to develop 
it.

Continuos integration: Occurs in projetcts that are stored in a ser-
ver with a update listenner the changes. Ex: Projects stored on 
GitHub.

-------------------------GENERAL TIPS-------------------------------


Focus in understand the mindfull of the agile methods.

A trouvle is simple whnen we're might to see for it an thinks in
a solution.

Be agile means be responsive to changes.

Finish your sprints always thinking in the solution of the pro-
blem, you sprint should be might to resolve the customer ques-
tion.

The project is a simple way to delivery the product.

Your client only will like to your software when he can see what
your software really delivery. Thus,focus in delivery good values.

You should implment functions accorgin the demand, if necessary you
should to reinplments the function. A functionality should be sim-
ple and attend to techinique excellence.

Professional with the model "T" are the most desirable, it is: that
professional that know little about various concepts and is especi-
alist in a single knowledgement.

Has a PRODUCT VISION BOARD before to starts your projects.

Estime the time of each functionalitie to develop trought story 
points, don't user hours for this.

You should to define your app criterics before to start the sprint.
