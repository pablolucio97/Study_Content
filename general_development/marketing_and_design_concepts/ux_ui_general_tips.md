# GENERAL UX/UI TIPS

## Design and Typography
- Avoid using more than two fonts in your projects. Use different sizes to create a visual hierarchy.
- Focus on typography and color schemes to create the visual identity of your project.
- Avoid large fonts on mobile devices.
- Maintain a consistent design pattern across all screens and pages of your application to create familiarity for the user.

## Color and Imagery
- Use a set color palette; the monochromatic circle can help combine your palettes.
- Implement only images that make sense in your application.
- Use high-quality images throughout the site.
- Pay attention to image and text contrast, especially if the text is on the image.
- Combine grayscale images and content to convey a message.
- Use various images to create a 3D effect for sites with physical products.
- Use cropped image overflow and background blur techniques to create immersion and focus.

## User Interaction
- Use large components to attract attention and smaller components for more delicate actions. Simplify user decisions.
- Use proximity points (icons or photos near words or phrases) to convey a message.
- Avoid meaningless animations. Use animations to represent ideas or emotions, and avoid repetition.
- Always provide user feedback. Use different colors for current elements and pop-ups for important actions.
- Show messages, progress bars, indicators, or animations during loadings.
- Reveal actions and processes in your application progressively and provide visual feedback.
- Prevent errors before they occur.
- Use language in your application that resonates with your target audience.

## Interface and Navigation
- Build a clean interface. Avoid creating buttons for every function in the app.
- Use 3D buttons to indicate actionable items.
- Define your functional hierarchy, focusing on primary and secondary actions, and display minimal information and elements.
- Simplify navigation. Ask for user information as needed and keep processes straightforward.
- Use microtexts for pages or searches not found.
- Avoid using "Send" on form buttons; use more descriptive phrases like "Do my register" or "I want to join."
- Test your application by having people use it.
- Dimension all components considering all available screen sizes. Be clear about your breakpoints.
- Resize your header on scroll to take up less space on the screen. Match your browser theme color with the header background color.

## Content and Messaging
- Show main ideas in the first section of your page. Be direct and to the point.
- Use clear and easy language that your clients understand.
- Have a robust search mechanism, especially for e-commerce and blogs.
- Use high-quality images and detailed descriptions for your products. Clearly state all available payment methods.
- Provide social login options and request registration only at the end of a purchase. Use forms with minimal data requirements and auto-fill options where possible.
- Consider offering a gift or incentive for purchasing your product or service.

## Additional Tips
- Consider the possibility of emitting sounds during clicks and user interactions.
- Use a spell checker when writing your text and review it before deploying.
- Keep the purchase button visible on all screens; consider placing it in the header.
- Show clear and friendly error messages to guide users through processes correctly.
- Use video backgrounds with good shadow and light settings if possible.
- Style the scrollbar.
- Maintain the original proportions of images. Calculate the proportions before rendering.
- Use 2400x1600 resolution for banners. For banner creation, use PNG images with padding and shapes like circles or squares. Ensure good text/background contrast and consider using icons (Flaticon can be a resource).
