*Inspired by insights from Paulo Cuenca, Luana Carolina, Malu Perini, Rafael Kiso, and Flávio Augusto.*

## 🎯 1. Mindset First — Understand Why You’re There
- **Social media is a means, not an end.** Use it to validate your existence and boost your business visibility.  
- **Comparison kills consistency.** Focus on your own progress, not others’ metrics. Celebrate small wins.  
- **The prize is intrinsic:** every effort online compounds into future visibility and opportunities.  
- **Don’t chase trends — own your narrative.** You’re not late; new people and platforms appear every year.

---

## 🧠 2. Think Like a Business Influencer
- Talk about **what you know**, not just what you sell.  
- Deliver **value before extracting value** — teach, share insights, simplify tech.  
- Be your brand’s **spokesperson**: it builds trust, lowers CAC, and increases authority.  
- Build **authority offline** (skills, results) → then **scale it online** through content.

---

## 💬 3. Build Conversations, Not Campaigns
- Stop interrupting; start interacting.  
- Instead of “buy my product,” say “here’s how to solve this problem.”  
- Join or create conversations around your niche — participate in **Trends** that align with your values.  
- Teach how to use your product rather than just announcing it.

---

## 🎨 4. Craft Authenticity and Narrative
- People don’t buy your **audience**, they buy your **narrative**.  
- Your **story** is the invisible bridge between your audience and your product.  
- Be selective: only promote products and partnerships that **fit your story**.  
- Authenticity converts more than aesthetics — be real, not perfect.

## 🧰 5. Platforms That Work in 2025
| Platform | Purpose | Growth Speed | Long-Term Value |

| **TikTok** | Awareness, virality | Fast | Medium |
| **Instagram** | Relationship, visual storytelling | Medium | Medium |
| **Spotify / Podcasts** | Credibility, storytelling | Slow | High |

## 📈 6. The 80/20 Growth Framework
- 80% of your effort: **proven platforms** (YouTube, Instagram).  
- 20%: **experimental ones** (TikTok, Threads, LinkedIn).  
- You’ll get **steady growth** from the stable ones, and potential **explosive growth** from new ones.  

---

## 🕰️ 7. Consistency Beats Talent
- Don’t expect fast success — think long term.  
- Algorithm = trust + time. You earn both through consistency.  
- Post → analyze → adapt → repeat.  
- Good enough today is better than perfect someday.

---

## 💎 8. Authentic Collaboration
- Choose collaborations where both sides share the **same values**.  
- Don’t let brands dictate your tone — people follow **your voice**, not scripts.  
- When hiring influencers, **buy their story**, not their follower count.

---

## 🪞 9. Self-Perception and Growth
- Carisma can be developed through **clarity and repetition**.  
- Observe what people already ask you advice for — that’s your content direction.  
- Build confidence by **teaching what you just learned**.  
- Every stage of growth has an audience waiting behind it.
