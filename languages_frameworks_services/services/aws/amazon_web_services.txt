====================AMAZON WEB SERVICES======================

AWS is a platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-ba-
sed products on-demad to compute, storage, network, database 
and other resources and management tools.

AWS Region is a geographical area consisted of two or more A-
vailability Zones.

Monolitcs Applications: Are applications with components 
highly linkeds.

Microervices: In this type of application, the components a-
re softly linkeds and each one can works without other. The 
low linkage avoids that all application falls.


----------------------CLOUD COMPUTING------------------------

The advantages of cloud computing:

You don't need to worry with your data center strucuture and 
can get focus in your projects.

You only paid for the resource that you're using in the right 
proportion. The data structure will maximize or minimize ac-
cording your needs.

------------CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT TYPES----------------

There are 3 types of clouding computing models:

Cloud: All parts of your application runs on cloud. And allows 
to migrate your applications to run on cloud.

Hybrid: Part of functionalities of your application are in the
cloud and other part are stored in phisic servers. You can im-
plemnt theses resources using virtualization tools.

On-premises: Allow to use dedicaded resources for an aplicat-
tion. You can use resources from the cloud conecting it in the 
on-premises (local) infrastructure in private way.


----------------MODELS OF CLOUD COMPUTING----------------------

Infrasctrucuture as a Service: 

Contains basic blocks for cloud IT and provide access to net-
working features of virtual machines an data storage space with 
highest level of flexiblility.

Platform as a Service:

Allow you to focus on the deployment of your application trought 
a platform.

Software as a Service:

Allow you focus on the deployment of your application trought 
a software provider. This works for example like an e-mail pro-
vider.



--------------------SELECTING A REGION------------------------

Select your region based on: Data governance legal require-
ments, proximty to customers, servies available within the 
region and costs. Each region has a cost.


===================AMAZON COMPUTING EC2========================

Advantges of EC2:

You not need buy phisic serves.

You create and stop EC2 instances fastly.

You pay only by what you are using by the time you're using.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Computing EC2 are flexibles servers that allow you access the 
virutal servers from Amazon. The EC2 is executed on phisic ma-
chines maneged from AWS using virtualization tecnology (hyper-
visor).

You can create an or vairous instance of EC2 to use resources 
from Amazon servers and use the multiple location (hardware 
sharing subjacent between virtual machines). At crerating a 
new instance of EC2 you can chose the S.O and softwares for 
build your application according your type these instances 
are resizables.

--------------------TYPES OF INSTANCES------------------------

Each instance of EC2 is optimezed for diferent task. Exmaples:

General: Applications, game servers, low and medium databases.

Optimezed for memory: Applications that requires high perfor-
mance.

Acellerated Computing: Applications that requires high gra-
phics proccessing and complex calcs.

Optmized for storage: Applications that requires high perfor-
mance for read and wirte data on databases, data warehousing.

Use Saving Plans for projects that will run during years and 
Spot Instances for flexbible applications that can support to
interruptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The scalibility is the act of begin a project with only with 
resources you need and plan your archteture to extends auto-
matically your needs. The scability should be applied for a-
voiding situations where has more request that your server 
can response.

--------------------AWS EC2 AUTO SCALING----------------------

Use the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to to add or removes automati-
cally instances of EC2. Are two types of scability:

Dynamic scability: EC2 expands automatically the number of 
instances according your application needs.

Predictive scalebility program: Expands the number of instan-
ces programmatically by according a preview demand, a mini-
mun and maximum instance number.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Using EC2:

1) Executes an E2C instance chosing the S.0, and the hardware 
config.

2)Conect with your instance trough a login or directly your 
pc work area.

3) Use your instance. You can run commands to install softwa-
res, add storage, copy and sort files and others.

works of TI according the business interests.

---------------------CLOUD MIGRATION STATEGIES-----------------------

There are 6 types of strategies for migrating apps on AWS cloud. The-
se strategies are:

Host redefinition: Know as "lift-and-shift' is a strategy that envol-
ves the movimentation of application without changes and only the host
is redefined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform replace: Know as "lift, tinker and shift' consist in do some 
little changes in the application for improve on cloud without change 
the application archteture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Refatoration: The architerure application need be redone viewing the 
benetifs of the cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebuild: The license of the application changes for a model "Software 
as service".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Retention: Consist in maintain the esentials applications in the o-
rigin environment and do refatoration before to migrate to cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Desactivation: Is the process of removes unnecesary applications.

------------------------AWS SNOW FAMILLY----------------------------

The AWS Snow Familli is a collection of phisical devices that help 
to transport phisiclly until the exabytes the data inside and outside 
of the AWS. The Snow Familly is composed for:

ate chatbots and others trought Amazon Lex.

You can create Machine Learning models trought the Amazon SageMaker 
fastly.

======================FEEDBACK AND BENEFITS==========================

------------------AWS WELL-ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK---------------------

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps to you undersatnd project 
and opere trusted systems on the AWS Cloud. Trough this framework 
you can check if your application was built with good practices ba-
sed on:

Operacional excellence: Resumes in the capcity of execute, monitore,
document and prevent falls continuosly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety: The capacity that yout application has in protect data in 
transit and retire.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Confiability: Is the capacity of your application has in get resour-
ces on demand and recovery data when is needs.

Exchange initials budgets for variables budgets where you don't need
initial investments on servers and goes paying only by used monthly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Benfits for massive scale economy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't need to know the capacity required and you can maximize 
and minimize the servers capacity on demand trought Amazon Elastic 
Compute Cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

More flexbility and speed by working with cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't need wast money with datacenters maintance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

You can expends your applications globally in minutes with low la-
tency.

======================GENERAL TIPS============================

How much is low your ping, better it is. You can test your la-
tence in www.cloudping.info.

At using a region, uses various available zones, because if a 
zone is offline your application still run in another server 
of another region.

The amazon networks create a cache for each request for pro-
vide this even response for other user more fastly trought 
presence point.
