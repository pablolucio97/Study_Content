every time code is merged or checked in, some tasks will running 
for check for your code and deploy it. we may want to run 
gradle tasks 

./gradlew lint checks bugs and potential improvements for cor-
rectness, security, performance,

./gradlew test

-----------------------DEFINING WORKFLOWS---------------------

Workflows are created as yaml files that must to inform when 
the code must run, what is the development environment looks
like and what tasks should be carried out by the workflow.

1) In your project root, create a new folder named as .git-
hub/workflows. The directory "github/workflows" is a special 
directory recognized by GitHub.

------------

2) Inside this folder, create your workflow file with the yml
extension. Ex: .github/workflows/deploy.yml. 

-----

2.1) Populate this file providing a name for your workflow 
(this name will be displayed in the workflows list in the a-
ctions tab under your repository).

-----

2.2) Say when the code must run (workflows can run in respon-
se to commits, pushes, schedully and more).

-----

2.3) Defines the jobs (actions) the workflow must execute.

Ex:

name: Android Build

on: pull_request

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses : actions/checkout@v1

      - name : Set Up JDK
        - uses : Set Up JDK



------------GENERAL TIPS--------------

Every workflow must have at least one job

GitHub supports you use your own runners or GitHub hosted run-
ners provided by GitHub.
