======================USING FIREBASE WITH REACT NATIVE==========================

Firebase is a platform to handle a back-end as services (BAS) providing 
databases, storage, and authentication API's. Firebase is free to start 
and your can scale your application if you desire.

1) Create a new project in the Firebase console

--------------------

2) Run yarn add @react-native-firebase/app to install the React Native Firebase 
lib in your React Native project.

--------------------

3) On your Firebase console, in the of your project, click on "Android", provide
a name com.yourname to your application (get it in the MainActivity.java file),
provide you app alias. Provide your certicate going to your project, navigating 
to android folde and typing the command ./gradlew signingReport, copy the SHA1 
code of the "debugAndroidTest" variant, paste in the field "Debug signing certi-
ficate SHA-1 (optional)" and click in "Register App".

--------------------

4) Download your google-services.json file and put it in android/app folder, and
click in "Next" in the Firebase console.

--------------------

5) Add the line classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10") inside an-
droid/build.gradlew inside the object buildscript>dependencies.

--------------------

6) In the android/app/build.gradlew add the lines:

apply plugin: "com.google.gms.google-services" after/below  the line 
apply plugin: "com.android.application"

----

implementation platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:29.2.1") and the line
implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics" atfer/below
implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+" 

--------------------

7) On the Firebase Console, click in "Next" and in "Continue", restart your app 
running "yarn android" (Firebase is a native confoguration and doesn't work with 
Expo Go) and test if your application works fine.
