---------------------------CLOUD FIRESTORE------------------------------

Cloud FireStore is a database no relational with JSON sysntax based on 
documents and collections where the data is stored in documents and sor-
ted in collections with real time updating. Each document is like an ob-
ject containing your own keys and the collections are a set of docu-
ments. Collections only can contain documents, and documents can't con-
tains collections. This database is high scalable and can be used in web 
and mobile applications that allows store, sync and handle data. Prefer
to use the FireStore than RealTime Database because the FireStore is a 
more new and atualized database based in the own RealTime.
