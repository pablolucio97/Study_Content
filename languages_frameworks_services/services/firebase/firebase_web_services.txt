databases, storage, and authentication API's. Firebase is free to start

---------------------------CLOUD FIRESTORE------------------------------

Cloud FireStore is a database not relational with JSON syntax based on 
documents and collections where the data is stored in documents and sor-
ted in collections with real-time updating. Each document is like an ob-
ject containing your own keys and the collections are a set of docu-
ments. Collections only can contain documents, and documents can't con-
tains collections. This database is highly scalable and can be used in web 
and mobile applications that allow store, sync and handle data. Prefer
to use the FireStore over than RealTime Database because the FireStore is 
a more new and actualized database based in the own RealTime.


----------------------------CLOUD STORAGE-------------------------------

les. Is a fast storage that you can store images, files and videos.
