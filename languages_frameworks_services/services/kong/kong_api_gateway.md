# Kong API Gateway

## Definition

Kong is an open source API gateway that has additional resource and it proxies (acts an intermediary) between the user request and the available services routing the user request to the correct service according to the request route.

## Kong characteristics
- Is open source
- Is a microgateway
- Allow Kubernetes integration easily
- Allow plugins

## Deployment models

**DB Less** In this model the source of truth is the declarative YAML or JSON file that includes all the configurations parsed in memory required to Kong starts.
**With database** In this model the source of truth is the shared database (generally PostgresSQL) that is a required dependency to Kong starts. Every Kong node must be in the same cluster.

## Deployment types
**Hybrid deployment (with DB)** This is the most recommended deployment type because all requests bump on Kong (control plane) first touch your nodes. In this model we have one control plane and one data plane for each node.
**Distributed deployment(DB-less)** This is type of deployment each node can bump on the database simultaneously. Its not recommended because the requests can charge the instance's resources. Here each node must have an identical database configuration file.

## Konga
Is the Kong dashboard that allows the user to visualize instance's metrics and user's controls.

**Downstream**: is the client consumer.
**Proxy**: is the request handler that redirects the request to the corresponding backend.
**Upstream**: is the service, the backend.



### Installing Kong and Konga

To install Kong, visit the instructions on: [Kong docs](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/install/docker/#install-kong-gateway-with-a-database)

To install Konga, clone the [Konga repository](https://github.com/pantsel/konga), install the dependencies using Node version 12 and run `npm start` to start the application. The Konga dashboard will be available at 1337 port.


### Using Konga

1. Create your connection.

2. Create a new service that must receive the same name of the container on your docker-compose file.

3. Create a new route to bind your service to the Konga's proxy.


### Konga Plugins

Plugins can be used on services, routes, consumers and globally, and are useful to manage rate limiting, requests identification and so on.

Adding a new plugin:
1. Go to [KongaHub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/) and search for your plugin. Read the plugin documentation to understand how it works.
2. On your Konga dashboard, click on "Plugins" to add a new plugin globally or click on a service and then add a new plugin to it.
3. Select the plugin category, select the plugin, and define it configurations.

The most used Konga's plugins are: 
- CorrelationID: Adds a new header allowing to identify the request by an generated UUID. Generally it is configured globally.
- RateLimitingIp: Define the maximum allowed request that your service can receive. Generally it is configured by service.
- Basic Authentication: Is a basic authentication plugins that block the request if has not the Authorization header configured. Generally it is configured by the email and password linked to a consumer.
- Key Authentication: Its a more reliable authentication plugin because it is based on the API key generated by Konga for each service. The user must inform the apiKey that must be the same service API key generated by Konga.

## Observability 

To correctly apply Observability on your system through API gateway, you should implement the following concepts in this order:

1. **Monitoring**: Watch the number of requests received, compare services usage and so on. Generally it is configured using Prometheus's image.
   
2. **Logs**: Logs produced by Kong are helpful to identify which service is receiving more requests, response times, error rates, and other relevant information. Logs can be centralized using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki for efficient search and visualization.

3. **Tracing (method used to monitor and observe requests as they travel through different services in a micro services architecture)**: Distributed tracing helps in tracking the flow of a request across multiple services. By implementing tracing, you can identify performance bottlenecks and understand the end-to-end latency of requests. Tools like Jaeger or Zipkin can be used to set up distributed tracing. 
  
## General tips
- Each node is an API/service.
- Always as possible work with hybrid deployment.
- At adding a new plugin into a service, define the rules based on each instance (local).
- At adding a new plugin, always hide the information on client headers to avoid hackers get information about your rate limits, timeout and etc.
- Avoid using heavy response formatters if you want to use Response Transformer plugin because it can consume a lot computational resources.
- Avoid using Basic Authentication on production, use Key Authentication instead.
- Generally monitoring and logging tools track headers information, and does not watches the request body for performance and security reasons.
