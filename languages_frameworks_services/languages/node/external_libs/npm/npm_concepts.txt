=============================NPM CONCEPTS===========================

Npm stands for Node Package Manager and is useful to fetch for a 
project and use it in your project or publish your own project for
the world.

You should type npm init -y to starting a new project, and you will 
have a package.json in the root folder of your project, like this:

{
  "name": "psd-react-component-test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "rollup -c",
    "start": "rollup -c -w"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.0.11",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.5",
    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-runtime": "^6.26.0",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "rollup": "^2.75.5",
    "rollup-plugin-sass": "^1.2.12",
    "rollup-plugin-typescript2": "^0.32.0",
    "typescript": "^4.7.3"
  }
}

name: Your project name.

version: The current version of your project. The last number after
point should change when the project has changed by bug fixes, the
second one when a new feature or resource has been added and the 
main number when the new version of project is incompatible with the
last project version.

description: Your project description.

main: The path containing the distribution file/folder.

scripts: Scripts that can be run in the project.

keywords: Your project keywords.

author: Your project author.

license: The license of your project.

devDependencies: The dev dependencies of your project. At creating 
a new project for publishing, you must to install all dependencies
as devDependencies.

---------------------------GENERAL TIPS-------------------------------

Use the command npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force to install de-
precated libs on legacy projects maintaining the original dependen-
cies not allowing automatic updates at installation.

The syntax of importation "import * as something from somewhere" must 
be used when the third lib doesn't have a default export.
