===========================DATA SAFETY==============================

------------------------TYPES OF ATTACKS----------------------------

Unauthoreized access: Occours when the hacker have the user password 
and does a unauthorized access.

Brutal force: Occours when the hacker as trying to guess the user 
password by tentatives.

Creddentials roub: Occours when the hacker have the user password 
and does a unauthorized access.

Sessiong Hijahacking: Happens when the hacker get a ride in the o-
pened real user session.

SQL/XML/JSON Inject: Happens when one pass parameters in your api 
route and do a request in your api getting ilegal data.

Cross Site Scripting: Occours whe one implement an script in the 
user computer and get ilegal data when the user is accesing your 
or another applications.

Request Fogery: Happens whe a session is created in the client 
browser and hacker implement a malicious code in the client com-
puter (geenrally trough sites of downloading) and this code get 
the data stored in the session of your application.

Overload Attack: Occours when your application has receiving 
thousands requests at evet time and your application get out of 
air. This can be done for SQL/XML/JSON Injection or Buffer Over-
flor (a huge param is passed to the api request for do it delays 
and overload).


----------------HOW TO STRENGH YOUR APP SAFETY--------------------

1) Use a secure authentication process, ex: OAuth2.
2) Use Multi Factor Authentication.
3) Count the excedded tentatives and block the IP.
4) Require a strong password at user registering.
5) Block the user IP if a exceding request to api is happening.
6) Implement SSL in your application.
7) Use a session expiring.
8) Use filter i each api response.
9) For private API's, check the site request origin for consume da-
ta.
10) Use a RAM memory limiter bounding the length of memory consu-
me for avoid overload attacks.

=========================GEERAL TIPS===============================

Seek for API's that have PCI certified to work with credit cards.

Maitaint a user actions log for prove for the user that he do an a-
ction inside your application.
