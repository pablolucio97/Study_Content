-------------------------MICROSSERVICES CONCEPTS------------------------

Microservices are the archteture where the system itself is splited in 
various another services (monolitics). There is an API Gateway to man-
age the access for microservices where the access to a specific servi-
ce/database (monolitic) is done based on the port linked to that mono-
litic each function of the system. 

This take various advantages, like: High scability, allow to use dif-
ferent technologies to build each service, easey maintanance, reuseble 
code, autonomy and agility. Microservices archteture should be imple-
mented if the business is growing up and you know all resources of the 
organization.

Monolitic is the archteture where the all functionalities of the system
are concentrede in the system itself.

Little applications trends to be molitics for avoid became complex.

Bigger applications trends to use microservices for distribute the res-
ponsabilities of the system to another services avoind hereby the chan-
ce of the software breaks itself and be more easy to make maintanance.
If you know that the system will receive more requests over an speci-
fic monolitic, you can add resources to this specific monolitic.

You can use different languages for build microsservices and do them 
communicate between.
