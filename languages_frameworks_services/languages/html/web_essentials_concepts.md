# Web Development Essentials

## Most Used HTML Web APIs

1. **Geolocation API**
   - Access the geographical location of the device.
2. **Web Storage API**
   - Mechanisms for storing data in the browser (`localStorage` and `sessionStorage`).
3. **Fetch API**
   - For making network requests, a modern alternative to `XMLHttpRequest`.
4. **Canvas API**
   - Enables drawing graphics via scripting.
5. **WebSockets**
   - Real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server.
6. **Service Workers API**
   - Background scripts for offline use and other features.
7. **Notifications API**
   - Control the display of system notifications to the end user.
8. **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**
   - Real-time communication of audio, video, and data.
9. **IndexedDB**
   - Client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data.
10. **File API**
    - Interact with file objects in web applications.

## Main Web Concepts

1. **Service Workers**
   - Background scripts running in the browser, enabling features like offline use.
2. **Microservices**
   - An architectural style for highly maintainable and loosely coupled services.
3. **Web Hooks**
   - User-defined HTTP callbacks triggered by specific events.
4. **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**
   - Web applications using common web technologies, optimized for a native-like experience.
5. **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**
   - Web applications that dynamically rewrite the current page rather than loading new pages.
6. **RESTful APIs**
   - APIs using HTTP requests to access and use data.
7. **GraphQL**
   - A query language for APIs with a type system for data.
8. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - Rendering a client-side SPA on the server before sending it to the client.
9. **Web Components**
   - Custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags for web pages and apps.
10. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
    - Geographically distributed network of proxy servers for optimized content delivery.
