==================DOING REVERSE PROXY ON EC2 LINUX INSTANCES====================

Your api should be open for thrid acess, is not a good practce up your server 
and opens a port (like 3333), a good practice is let the default port opened 
(80). Because this you need to do Reverse Proxy.

1) Run sudo apt install nginx to install Nginx.

---------------------

2) On your AWS console, click on "Network & Security", "Security Groups", 
click on your instance (probabilly launch-wizard), "Edit inbound rules", "Add 
rules" , select HTTP and select "Anywhere IPV4". Repeat the process for HTTPS
too and click on "Save rules". You should be able to acess the nginx page 
through your public IP after 30 seconds.

---------------------

3) Logged as root user, navigates until /etc/nginx/sites-available, run touch 
your_site_name, run sudo vim your_site_name and define this confiruation (press 
CTRL + C, in sequence type !wq to exit edition). Run ls and check if the new 
file is here.

Configuration code:

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3333;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
}

---------------------

4) Backs a dir, navigates untill sites-enabled, run sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/
sites-available/your_site_name your_site_name. In sequence back to cd ../si-
tes-available and run sudo rm default, repeat the process for the /sites-e-
nabled dir.

---------------------

5) On /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory, run sudo service nginx restart,
navigates until your project dir and start the server appoint to your 
server.ts file through node server_file_dir/server.js
