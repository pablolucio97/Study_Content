=============DOING AUTOMATED BUILD WITH GITHUB ACTIONS===============

To do an automatic build using GtHub actions, you need to define a 
workflow for the CI and the another for the CD.

1) Define the CI workflow:

1.1) Inside your project create a new folder named as .github/work-
flows, and inside this a new file named as ci.yml.

1.2) Provide a name and define the jobs for the CI workflow.

name: Continuos Integration

on:
  pull_request:
    branchs:
      - develop
      - main

    - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
