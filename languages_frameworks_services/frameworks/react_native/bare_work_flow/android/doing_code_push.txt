==========================DOING CODE PUSH OTA=============================

Code Push OTA means updating over the air and consists in sending your 
app updates directly to the end-user without going to stores. The new re-
sources will be available only if your app already has been downloaded. 
All updates will be installed in the second plan while the user uses the 
app.
