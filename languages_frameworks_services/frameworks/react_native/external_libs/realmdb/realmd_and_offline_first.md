# Introduction to RealmDB and Offline First Strategy

## Overview

This course will cover RealmDB, a high-performance database designed for mobile applications, and the "offline first" strategy, a crucial approach for ensuring that applications can work seamlessly even without constant internet access. 

## What is RealmDB?

RealmDB is an object-oriented database specifically optimized for mobile applications. It is written in C++ and follows a NoSQL approach, meaning it uses schemas similar to those found in document-based databases. Key features of RealmDB include:

- **High Performance**: Engineered for mobile environments, RealmDB provides fast and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Scalability**: It can handle increasing loads as applications grow in size and complexity.
- **Offline-First Capabilities**: Data is stored locally first and can be synced with an online version when an internet connection is available.

## Understanding Offline First Strategy

The "offline first" strategy emphasizes ensuring that an application can continue functioning even without internet access. Data is initially stored locally and synchronized when a connection becomes available. This strategy allows for a better user experience in situations where internet connectivity is unreliable. At working with Offline First Strategy, you must maintain a local (with only needed data) and an online versions of your application data. 

### Steps to Implement Offline First

1. **Identify Key Functionalities**: The first step in designing an offline-first application is to determine which parts of the application need to work without internet access. For example, user login with Google authentication requires online access, but viewing certain data could be done offline.

2. **Strategic Implementation**: You don't need to implement offline-first for the entire application. Focus on specific features or modules where offline access makes the most sense. Some parts of the application may require live data, while others can function with locally stored data.

3. **Combination of Storage Solutions**: RealmDB can be combined with other storage options like AsyncStorage, depending on the applicationâ€™s needs. This flexibility ensures that developers can tailor the solution to meet the specific requirements of their app.

4. **Business Rules Considerations**: Offline-first implementation should align with the application's business rules. For example, in an inventory app, ensuring real-time data for stock availability might be crucial to avoid overselling products that are no longer in stock.

## Key Considerations for Offline First

- **Feature Planning**: Decide early on which functionalities will work offline and which ones require real-time internet access.
- **Data Synchronization**: After implementing local storage, set up data synchronization to ensure that offline changes are reflected in the online database once connectivity is restored.
- **Strategic Focus**: Offline-first does not have to apply to the entire application. Focus on critical areas that benefit the most from offline functionality.

Observation: RealmDB was designed to be used with MongoDB Atlas, so to use it you'll need provide the app id on your AppProvider.
