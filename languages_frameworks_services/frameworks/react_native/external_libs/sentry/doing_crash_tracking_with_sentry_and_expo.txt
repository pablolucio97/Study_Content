=====================DOING CRASH TRACKING WITH SENTRY=====================

Crash tracking is the action of tracking errors and being aware of them 
before the user finds and reports them. When an error occurs, It also is 
reported to the developer's team immediately.


1) Do login in your Sentry account and go to "Projects", "Create project", 
select the technology, mark the option "Alert me on every new issue", pro-
vide your app name and click in "Create project".

----------------------

2) Run expo install sentry-expo to install the Sentry.

----------------------

3) Run also expo install expo-application expo-constants expo-device 
expo-updates @sentry/react-native to install Sentry additional required 
libs.

----------------------

4) Add a new expo hook in your app.json file to listen to the Sentry. 

{
  "expo": {
    // ... your existing configuration
    "plugins": ["sentry-expo"],
    "hooks": {
      "postPublish": [
        {
          "file": "sentry-expo/upload-sourcemaps",
          "config": {
            "organization": "your sentry organization's name",
            "project": "your sentry project's name here",
            "authToken": "your auth token here"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

Obs: Go to https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/ to generate 
your token

----------------------

5) Go to your App.tsx file and import * as Sentry and listen Sentry.init 
passing your Sentry general url inside an useEffect to listen all possible 
errors on the application. Example:

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Home } from './src/pages/Home'
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

export default function App() {
    
    useEffect(() => {
        Sentry.init({
            dsn: 
            "https://https://db686fb0ce79483591ae7b2a7d68c4a7@o1167557.
            ingest.sentry.io/4534533",
            enableInExpoDevelopment: true
        })
    }, [])

    return (
        <Home />
    )
}

----------------------

6) Simulate an error on your application and watch the error be reported 
on your Sentry dashboard. You can see each error separatedlly with all
device infos where the error has occurred.
