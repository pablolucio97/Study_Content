=======================WORKING WITH OFFLINE FIRST========================

At planning your app, you should think if your app will use resources 
that demands internet and plan the app behavior when the internet is not 
available. You should store data and images in the cache when has in-
ternet and show them when no has internet. Also, some components should 
be displayed only if has internet. Example:

Resources with the internet:

1)Create an account.
2)Do login.
3)Finish a buy.

Resources without internet:

1)List all items offline stored on the local database.
2)Show stored images in the cache.
3)Hide button to finish a buy.



-----------------------AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY FLOW------------------------

1) User tries to sign up, the data is sent and validated by the API that 
checks if the email is available to register.

---------------------

2) User tries to sign in, the email and password is checked on the API, and 
the API return with a token containing the user info, user role permisions 
and authorizing the user to proced with sign in.

---------------------

3) The application stores the token and the user info on app device through
a offiline db to user not need to sign in again and get your info while the 
token is valid. If the users do log out, then your token expires and he ne-
ed to sign in again.

---------------------

4) If the user updates your info, first it is done on device storage and so 
is updated in the server.
