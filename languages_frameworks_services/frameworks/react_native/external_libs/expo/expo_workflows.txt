===========================TYPES OF EXPO WORKFLOWS===============================

Manager Workflow: Is the most simple and managed flow where is possible to use 
only API's that not requires native code management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bare Workflow: Workflow where the native code is exposed, but it necesary to set
up manually to use more API's that requires native code management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expo Prebuild: Is used to do automatically the native configuration on libs that 
requires native confiuration. These alterations are done through the installed 
plugins declared on app.json. Expo Prebuild converts the project to Bare Work-
flow at its first execution, or run automated confirations based on plugins at 
next executions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development Builds (expo-dev-client): Is used to create a custom compilation for 
development. You need to create a development client and install it on the devi-
ce always you need to implement API's that require native code configuration. 
You must use the script expo start --dev-client.

===============================GENERAL TIPS=====================================

Don't alter the native code if you're using expo prebuild, because the expo pre-
build will overwrite these alterations.

Expo prebuild only watchs the plugins declared on app.json.

At runnig the command expo prebuild, the native folder can be geenrated again 
with the respect changes

If you're doing mannualy the native configurations, use expo-dev-client. Do not
mix expo prebuild with expo-dev-client.

Is prefered to use expo prebuild instead expo-dev-client because expo perbuild 
will care about the native configurations based on plugins.

You can use plugins with expo prebuild to handle all native code instead do it
manually.
