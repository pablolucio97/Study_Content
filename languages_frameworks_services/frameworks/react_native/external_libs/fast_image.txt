----------------------------FAST IMAGE-----------------------------

Fast Image is a lib to do image caching and allow fast loading of
the images of your application after then it has been loaded one 
time.

1) Run yarn add react-native-fast-image to install the Fast Image.

Maybe you need to link the dependency manually running: 
yarn react-native link react-native-fast-image.

-------------------

2) In your application substitute your common component image to 
the FastImage. Example:

import FastImage from 'react-native-fast-image'

export const CarImage = styled(FastImage)`
    width: 240px;
    height: 120px;
`
