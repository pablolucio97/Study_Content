===========================VITE COURSE===============================

Vite is a tool that does the application compilation automatically 
and uses esmodules by default where is not necessary to use another 
bundler pack, like WebPack. This tool is more performatic. Vite uses
the tag script with attribute "type" = "module" inside the idex.html 
inside public folder to manager esmodules. Vite is an alternative to 
common React CRA, it was wrote in GO, and is between 10 x 100 times 
more faster than the conventional CRA.

Recently browsers started importing files by itself through esmodules 
to import and export files. To use this feature, is recommended crea-
te projects using ViteJS because ViteJS already does the compilation
automatically and bundling is not necessary.
