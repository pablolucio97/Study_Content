===========================VITE COURSE===============================

Babel: Compiles our all JavaScript code containing modern featues to 
an JavScript that old browsers also understands.

WebPack: Transform our all files imported and exported in the appli-
cation in files that the browser can read. This takes time and can 
downgrade your application performance.

Recently browsers started importing files by itself through esmodules 
to import and export files. To use this feature, is recommended crea-
te projects using ViteJS because ViteJS already does the compilation
automatically and bundling is not necessary.

Vite is a tool that does the application compilation automatically 
and uses esmodules by default where is not necessary to use another 
bundler pack, like WebPack. This tool is more performatic. Vite uses
the tag script with attribute "type" = "module" inside the idex.html 
inside public folder to manager esmodules.
