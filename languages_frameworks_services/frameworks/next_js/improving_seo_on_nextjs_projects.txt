========================IMPROVING SEO ON NEXTS PROJECTS======================

To improve SEO in your NextJS projects you should to pay attention to Meta
Tags, Performance, Accessibility and PWA's.

Meta tags:

A meta tag basically tells the search engines what the content of that spe-
cific page is, what exactly that page is about, and how the search engine
should show it.


1. Use the Head from 'next/head' to provide title and all meta tags of your
website in each page of your application with a key to guarantee that will be 
renderized only once.

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
<meta name="description" content="pablosilvadev" key="description" />
<meta name="author" content="Pablo Silva" key="author" />
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" key="theme-color" />

title: The title that your page receives is the same will be displayed on 
Google search. Titles are critical to giving users a quick insight into the 
content of a result.

---------

description: The description tag summarizes the page content that search 
engines often use it for the snippet in search results. This is used to con-
vince your visitor that the page is exactly what they're looking for.

---------

robots: Robots tag tells search engines if and how they should crawl your web 
pages. Using the wrong attributes in the meta robots tag can have a catastro-
phic impact on your siteâ€™s presence in the search results.

---------

viewport: Viewport is very important because it tells to Google that your 
page is mobile-friendly and it can raise your position on search's.

---------------------

charset: Responsible for tells the browser how the text on your web page should 
be displayed. Using the wrong character encoding can cause some characters to 
display incorrectly in the browser.

---------------------

Performance:

The performance is based on metrics, the main metrics are: 
FCP : First Contentful Paint (is the most important).
LCP: Largest Contentful Paint

You can use Next.js to measure and tell you some metrics creating a custom 
function called reportWebVitals in your app.tsx file. Example:

export function reportWebVitals(metric) {
  console.log(metric)
}

Accessibility

Progressive web apps

----------------------

-------------------------------GENERAL TIPS------------------------------------

Use a SSL certificate in your page because Google take it on consideration at 
indexing your page.

Write a unique title tag for each page. Create something click-worthy under 60
characters with a target keyword.

Write a unique description tag for with specific content for each page, avoid 
generic descriptions trying to summarize content accurately, and keep it under 
120 characters.

Use the robots tags only when you want to restrict the way Google crawls a pa-
ge. This can be dangerous and rogue your SEO if configured incorrectly. Never 
sets robots tag with "nofollow" and "noindex" attributes.

Use meta viewport tag on all web pages.

Use the meta charset tag on all webpages with UTF-8 value. 

Avoid the meta refresh redirect tag unless absolutely necessary.

Don't use the meta keywords because Google doesn't has used meta keywords for 
rankings since 2009 because many have abused it, so Google faces it as spam.
