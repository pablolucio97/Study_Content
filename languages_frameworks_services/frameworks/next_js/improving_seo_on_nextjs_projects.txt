========================IMPROVING SEO ON NEXTS PROJECTS======================

To improve SEO in your NextJS projects you should to pay attention to Meta
Tags, Performance, Accessibility and PWA's.

Meta tags:

A meta tag basically tells the search engines what the content of that spe-
cific page is, what exactly that page is about, and how the search engine
should show it.

1. Use the Head from 'next/head' to provide title and all meta tags of your
website in each page of your application with a key to guarantee that will be 
renderized only once.

<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
<meta name="description" content="pablosilvadev" key="description" />
<meta name="keywords" content="pablosilvadev " key="keywords" />
<meta name="author" content="pablosilvadev" key="author" />
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" key="theme-color" />


---------------------

Performance:

The performance is based on metrics, the main metrics are: 
FCP : First Contentful Paint (is the most important).
LCP: Largest Contentful Paint

You can use Next.js to measure and tell you some metrics creating a custom 
function called reportWebVitals in your app.tsx file. Example:

export function reportWebVitals(metric) {
  console.log(metric)
}

-------------------------------GENERAL TIPS------------------------------------

Use a SSL certificate in your page because Google take it on consideration at 
indexing your page.
