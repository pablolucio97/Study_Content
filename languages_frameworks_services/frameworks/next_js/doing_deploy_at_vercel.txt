============================DOING DEPLOY AT VERCEL=================================

1) Check if your code is done to go to production and is committed correctly.

-----------------------

------------------------

2) Go to the Vercel website and go to https://vercel.com/new to create a new 
project.

------------------------

3) Skip the team step, and add your envinronment variables and do the deploy. 

------------------------

5) If your application use resources linked to AOauth, adjust your app AOauth 
application redirecting it correctly to your new Vercel address app going to
https://github.com/settings/developers and click in AOauthApps and your current 
application and change the Homepage URL and Authorization callback URL. Example:

Authorization callback URL: https://ignews-pablosilva.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
Homepage URL: https://ignews-pablosilva.vercel.app/

------------------------

6)If your application use NextAuth, add an environment variable named NEXTAUTH_URL
with the URL of your application after deployment, e.g: https://ignews.vercel.app/ 
in your Vercel environment variables panel.


-------------------------------GENERAL TIPS----------------------------------------

Add all env variables of your application in the Vercel panel.

All services that communicate with NextAuth should redirect the authentication to 
your new Vercel URL.

Change your baseURL at services/api to your new Vercel URL.

If you're using Mongo, add env variables to  MongoURI and MongoDbName and allow your
cluster to all IP's passing 0.0.0.0/0 as the default IP.
