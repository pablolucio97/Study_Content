===================CLEAN ARCHITECTURE ON NODEJS APPLICATIONS====================

In the Clean Architecture, the useCases layer doesn't must depends on the 
controllers layers.

Your application adopts the Clean Architecture concept when it's possible to 
change your entire useCases and entities layer without affect controllers 
layer.

--------------------------Clean Architecture flow-------------------------------

Development flow: Dtabase => Repository => Entities => Use Cases => Controllers 
=> Client 
--------

Client Request flow: Client => Controllers () => Use Case () => Entities => 
Repository => Database

Concepts:

Database: Is the database itself.

------

Repository: Is the contract containing the methods of your system to handle 
data in the database that will be available for each use case according to 
the method the use case needs.

------

Entities: Are the representation of your database tables in the code.

------

Use Cases: Are the responsible for communicate with your entities performing  
each method of your system according your business rules. Is necessary a 
repository containing all methods of your system for each use case know 
which method implement in the current use case.

------

Controllers: Are the responsible for protect the system from client's request 
checking if the request sent by client attends to the business rules.

------

Client: Is the client is sending a request. Can be any client, device or web.
