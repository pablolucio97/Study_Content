# DATA SAFETY

## Types of Attacks

### Unauthorized Access
Occurs when a hacker gains access using a user's password.

### Brute Force
Involves guessing the user's password through multiple attempts.

### Credential Theft
Occurs when a hacker obtains a user's password and accesses the system without authorization.

### Session Hijacking
Happens when a hacker takes over a legitimate user's session.

### SQL/XML/JSON Injection
Occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into an API request to illegally access data.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Occurs when an attacker implements a script on the user's computer to steal data while the user accesses your or other applications.

### Request Forgery
Occurs when a session is created in the client's browser, and a hacker implements malicious code on the client's computer (often through download sites), which then accesses data stored in your application's session.

### Overload Attack
Occurs when an application receives thousands of requests simultaneously, causing it to crash. This can be due to SQL/XML/JSON Injection or Buffer Overflow (passing a large parameter to the API request to cause delays and overload).

## Strengthening App Safety

1. **Secure Authentication**: Implement secure authentication processes, such as OAuth2.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhance security with multiple authentication steps.
3. **Limit Login Attempts**: Block IP addresses after excessive failed login attempts.
4. **Strong Password Policies**: Require strong passwords during user registration.
5. **IP Blocking**: Block IPs that make excessive requests to the API.
6. **SSL Implementation**: Use SSL to secure data transmission.
7. **Session Expiry**: Implement session expiration for added security.
8. **Response Filtering**: Apply filters to each API response.
9. **Origin Checks**: For private APIs, verify the request's origin.
10. **Memory Limiters**: Implement RAM memory limiters to prevent overload attacks.

## General Tips

- **PCI Compliance**: Look for APIs that are PCI certified for handling credit card transactions.
- **User Action Logs**: Maintain logs of user actions to provide proof of activities within your application.
