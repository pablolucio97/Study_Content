# 📦 Webpack Concepts

Webpack is a modular building system built with NodeJS. It allows handling CSS, JavaScript, and other assets like images using the correct plugin. The **Webpack loaders** are Node modules that process and transform imported files into client-ready code, checking each file individually.

## ⚙️ Understanding Webpack Configuration

To configure Webpack manually in your project, create a `webpack.config.js` file at the root of your project.

### ✅ Example:

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './src/index.html' })],
  mode: 'production'
};
```

### 🧩 Explanation

- **entry**: Path to the main file Webpack uses to build the dependency graph. Default: `./src/index.js`.
- **output**: Defines where Webpack emits bundles and how they're named. Default: `./dist/main.js`.
- **module**: Defines rules for loaders used to process specific file types.
- **plugins**: Used for broader tasks like optimizations, injecting HTML, etc.
- **mode**: Can be `'production'`, `'development'`, or `'none'`, setting optimization levels accordingly.

## 🗺️ Source Maps

Source maps allow third-party libraries and the browser to map minified code back to the original source, making debugging easier and more accurate.

## 🔌 Main Webpack Plugins

### `html-webpack-plugin`
Simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your Webpack bundles. It generates a hashed HTML file that only reloads changed parts of the application.

### `webpack-dev-server`
Provides a live development server that automatically compiles and updates the application using `socket.io`.

### `react-refresh-webpack-plugin`
Enables **fast refresh** in React applications during development, improving the DX (Developer Experience).

---

## 🧱 Loaders

Webpack natively understands only JavaScript and JSON. **Loaders** transform other types of files into valid modules.

### 🔹 `css-loader`
Lets you import `.css` files inside JavaScript/JSX. It transforms CSS into JS modules and ensures compatibility with older browsers.

### 🔹 `sass-loader`
Enables importing and using `.sass`/`.scss` files in JavaScript/JSX, converting them into browser-compatible CSS.

### 🔹 `sass-node`
(You probably meant `node-sass` or `sass` package) — Used on the server-side to compile Sass to CSS.
