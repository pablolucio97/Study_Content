- Symbolic AI: Is a subarea of the Narrow AI, where it acts like a big dictionary basicly formed by too many conditional blocks.
- Machine Learning: Is a subarea of the Narrow AI weere the AI start learning from the provided data.
- Deep Learning: Is a set of various Machine Learnings.
- Reinforced Learning: Is a subarea of the Narrow AI weere the AI start learning from feedback. Ex: AI playing I game, in the first tentative it will fail, after several feedbacks, it will over the game perfectly.

## General Tips
